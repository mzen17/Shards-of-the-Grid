# Shards of the Grid
An interactive game held on Heroku.

This was developed by Team 9 of CS:5820 SELT.

## Repository
This is a fork repository maintained by one of the developers, Mike Zeng, in case the [official one](https://github.com/uiowahjmjohnsonselt2024/projectdirectory-selt_2024_team_009) gets taken down. This project will exist here as reference as it is one of my two software capstone classes @University of Iowa. I'm quite proud of how well my team performed and the app that we produced.
